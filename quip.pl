=head1 NAME

quip.pl - A simple cli note-taking app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This rev. of quip uses Vimwiki for storage, mostly because I'm using Vimwiki and 
keeping everything in one place appeals to me.

At present there are two uses for quip in Vimwiki:
    - Recording todo items
    - Recording short notes and reminders

More use cases may present themselves; for now, I'm limiting this to these two
pages.
