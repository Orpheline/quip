quip.pl
version: $VERSION

Quip is a simple tool for capturing timestamped, tagged notes from
the command line.

USAGE:
    quip [-category] [-tags] -n note     Add a note.
    quip -h          Â                    Print help.

FLAGS:
    -c, --category string    Descriptive category for note
    -h, --help               Displays usage
    -n, --note string        Note content
    -t, --tag string(s)      Associated tags (allows multiple tags)    
    -u, --usage              Displays usage
    -v, --version            Displays version

REQUIREMENTS:
    Aside from the necessary Perl CPAN modules, quip's only requirement
    is the creation of a target file for notes.  It takes the path from
    the QUIP_NOTES environment variable.

EXAMPLES:

    quip -h
        Prints this help

    quip -n "The quick brown fox"
        2019-05-22T04:48:03.741,general,'The quick brown fox'

    quip -c idea -n 'Have lunch with Jed' -t lunch -t colleague
        2019-05-22T06:10:25.095,idea,'Have lunch with Jed',lunch:colleague
        Example:
            quip todo Buy coffee at the store

Quip is a simple CLI for quickly capturing one-line notes or TODO items.

does not exist, it creates a default template and returns the contents of that
template.

Returns the oath to the top-level quip directory.  

Quip looks in the following places for its' artifacts:

    $XDG-CONFIG-HOME        Environment variable described in the
                            freedesktop.org specification

    /home/<user>/.config    Common default directory for program configs

    /home/<user>/.quip      Fallback to a home directory dotfile

Should the quip directory not exist, quip will create it in one of the above
directories. 

=head2 default_config

Returns a perl hashref with a default quip configuration.

=head2 save_quip

Takes a hashref as input.  Format:

    {
        type => Type of message,
        body => Message body

    }
