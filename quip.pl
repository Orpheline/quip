=head1 NAME

quip.pl - A simple cli note-taking app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Quip is a command line tool to capture short notes and tasks.  The goal is to
capture ad hoc thoughts quickly and with as small an interruption to ones'
workflow as possible.

Quip assumes the first word following its' call ( C<$0> ) is the note type 
(ex, note, TODO, etc.) and that all following text is the associated message.

Quip stores its' notes under C<~/quip/>; however, this can be tuned by editing
C<~/.quiprc.yaml>

NOTE: I have many, many interruptions and digressions in my life, and projects
may sit idle for weeks or months until I come back to them.  Because of this,
and because this script is early in development, it is very heavily commented.
As work progresses and the design and functionality are refined, commentary will
be cleaned up to something resonably documentary without excessive verbosity.

Yes, that includes this description ;).
